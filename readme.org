* Luis + Reed WebRTC Project

** Goal: Make an app where two people can communicate.
*** Floobits.com - Synchronous file editing
*** Peer connection between two computers
**** Vs. a normal app where there is a server between those two computers
**** Start with a server to get peer connected to find eachother
**** Tech missing from web browsers: Talking to anyone directly - because we can't signal to each other

** Pair Programming
*** One person's driving, one person navigator
*** Strong style pair programming - "To go into the computer, an idea has to go through the other person's head first"

** Tech:
*** Server
**** NodeJS - JavaScript
**** Socket.io - NodeJS library
***** WebSockets - Push and pull messages between server
**** Express - Server Framework
*** Dev Environment
**** ~~Floobits.com for pair programming~~
**** ZeroTier to connect our computers together

* [X] Goal: Build a web server that Luis and Reed can talk to each other *through* in *real time*

- [X] Define a JavaScript environment where we can install packages
- [X] Create a socket.io and express server that echos.  https://socket.io/docs/
- [X] On the server, for any message on the topic "broadcast", broadcast to all clients
- [ ] Use socket.io's rooms to send to a particular person
  - [X] Server should listen for join
  - [ ] When a user joins they can broadcast FROM their own name
  - [ ] A user can also send a DM to any user by name
  - [X] Each browser has a button that says join
  - [X] Input to write your name
  - [X] Each browser join a rooms by their unique username to receive DMs
  - [X] Each browser listens for DMs to the room of its username and logs
  - [X] Hiding the join interace after joining
  - [ ] Other browsers send to the room
    - [ ] Server should listen for "dm" message on socket
      - Takes name, message
- [ ] Don't globally broadcast, send to a particular person


* Next goal: Make that server only facilitate connection so that Luis and Reed can talk to eachother *directly*
** Signaling is that facilitation
